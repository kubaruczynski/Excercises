# Exercises

### Hi there!

Seems like you've found yourself some programming exercises to do. 
The list below is kind of a mess right now, but is constantly being 
fixed and more stuff is (and will be in foreseeable future) added. 

-----

## [Math problems](docs/mathProblems.md)

Problems in this category are mostly _math_ related. They tend to be
as easy as just retyping math equation to programming language, but 
difficulty rises with complexity with equation. 

Currently there are 16 _math_ problems to solve.

## [General problems](docs/generalProblems.md)

This category is a mix of different problems not really related to
anything. Some might require a bit more skill or knowledge than just 
math or coding, but definitely a lot of creativity.

Currently there are 19 _general_ problems to solve.

You can always ask me anything anytime.

If you have an idea for a new exercise you can create issue, or PR.
